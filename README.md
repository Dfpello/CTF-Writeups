# Cybersecurity Portfolio: Technical Write-ups 🛡️

Welcome to my security research and CTF repository. This space is dedicated to documenting the exploitation and remediation of various machines from platforms like **DockerLabs**, **HackTheBox**, and **TryHackMe**.

The primary focus is to demonstrate a structured, professional methodology in **Penetration Testing** and **Vulnerability Assessment**.

## 📖 Methodology
Every write-up in this repository follows a standardized 4-step process to ensure clarity and technical depth:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** High-speed scanning and service fingerprinting.
2.  **Foothold:** Identification of entry-point vulnerabilities (CVEs, misconfigurations).
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Internal enumeration to move from low-privilege users to **Root/System**.
4.  **Remediation:** Implementation of hardening measures and security patches.
